# GameTrainerApp
App that will see what you are doing when playing games to then train you to be better at the game or to understand why you failed or why you didn't fail.
The code is free to use, if you found anything wrong, please tell me so that I can learn from it, if you want to change something in the code just do it, feel free to have fun with this and destoy it.
App version 0.0.5

(I am a Bachelor's CS student doing this beacuse I wanted to, and the idea came to my mind one day)
